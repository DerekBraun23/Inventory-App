# Inventory-App
IT Inventory App to track assets, add, move, change, assign barcodes to assets, etc. Also creates user accounts with security tests for username and password logins.


Must have latest version of Android Studio. Must use a Pixel emulator phone, OR download the .apk file to install on your phone for testing.

User registration is free and for the public. I can see all users and encrypted passwords in my firebase-database provided by Google. Account recovery as well as account disabling can be done through my database.
